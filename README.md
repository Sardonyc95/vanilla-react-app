## Static Webpage
- The above static weather app project helped me understood how the react.js framework can be used.

- I learnt the difference between HTML and Jsx.

- CSS styling of different components.

- Javascript Components structuring and usage.

- Most importantly creating a react app using the command line.

- Still on the project to build a functional interface and user friendly weather app using react.js...

## Responsive/Real-Life application Webpage
- The vanilla react app is now functional and uses real life data.
- The statements below will help you understand the functionality better.

### Integration of Bootstrap
- using bootstrap to make the static webpage more responsive
- restructuring of the webpage using HTML/JSX with bootstrap css. 

### API Integration
- Structuring of the API call and get response using axios > axios.get(apiUrl).then(handleResponse);
- This helps to get real life weather data which is displayed on the UI of the vanilla react app such as the city, country, date, weather description, weather icon, temperature element(celsius, pressure, humidity, wind, etc.)

### Search Engine
- Enabling the search engine to be functional by having a click event listener on the form and input tag.
- It helps to store input value given by users to inturn give the user the required response or weather information requested, which is displayed on the UI afterword.

### Unit Coversion
- Conversion of the temperature to either celsius or fahrenheit when clicked on the either C or F text is enabled by making each a link and giving a attribute the call a function that stores their updated value.
- Optimizing the conversion of the temperature from celsius to fahrenheit and vise visa was really amazing and effective.
- This helps to display the different value of each parameter.
