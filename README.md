# vanilla-react-app

Static Webpage:
- The above static weather app project helped me understood how the react.js framework can be used.

- I learnt the difference between HTML and Jsx.

- CSS styling of different components.

- Javascript Components structuring and usage.

- Most importantly creating a react app using the command line.

- Still on the project to build a functional interface and user friendly weather app using react.js...

Integration of bootstrap:
- using bootstrap to make the static webpage more responsive
- restructuring of the webpage using HTML/JSX with bootstrap css.
