# vanilla-react-app

- The above static weather app project helped me understood how the react.js framework can be used.

- I learnt the difference between HTML and Jsx.

- CSS styling of different components.

- Javascript Components structuring and usage.

- Most importantly creating a react app using the command line.

- Still on the project to build a functional interface and user friendly weather app using react.js...
